                    <h3>Welcome to the DevOps World</h3>
                    <p>
                      An introduction to the DevOps paradigm and the focus areas. Also, the relationship between DevOps, DevSecOps, and Agile in light of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), in the end, is the initial phase of the HiveBox project.

                    <h3>Basics - DevOps Core</h3>
                    <p>
                      Learn Python fundamentals, common development tools, and Git basics. Then, gain Linux essentials, common tools, and bash scripting skills. Also, cover Docker fundamentals — finally, a hands-on with the HiveBox project.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="event" data-date="Module 3">

                    <p>
                     Define goals, prioritize requirements, dive into code modularity, and then move to testing and quality assurance. Implement unit tests, follow Docker best practices, and explore quality gates in continuous integration with GitHub Actions — finally, a hands-on with the HiveBox project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Review goals in planning, then apply the Twelve-Factor App methodology and REST API best practices. Embrace Kubernetes for container orchestration. Then explore observability, dive into continuous delivery solutions, also an overview of Cloud Computing — and finally, a hands-on with the HiveBox project.

                    <p>
                      Refine goals, integrate code with external systems, and write integration tests. Also, utilize Infrastructure as Code, learn Terraform essentials, and Kubernetes configuration management like Helm and Kustomize. Then, implement CD best practices — and finally, a hands-on with the HiveBox project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Conduct Agile retrospective to analyze the improvement areas, optimize code performance, and secure the software supply chain. Then, implement a multi-environment architecture with a log aggregation system for observability. Also, set up end-to-end release automation, explore continuous deployment with GitOps and Argo CD — and finally, a hands-on with the HiveBox project.
